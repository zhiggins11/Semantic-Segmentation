# Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation

This is work that I did as part of a group project (with Lingxi Li, Yejun Li, Jiawen Zeng, and Yunyi Zhang) for CSE 251B (Neural Networks).  I benefited from discussions with my partners, but all code here was either given by the instructor or written by me.  Specifically, I created the model (basic_fcn.py) and wrote the code for training the model and evaluating it on the validation and tests sets (basic_fcn.py and util.py), and the instructor gave us all the code for loading the data.


This project has several fully convolutional networks which can be used to perform semantic segmentation.  It uses a subset of the India Driving Dataset to train, validate, and test the models.  Links to the images in the training, validation, and test sets are found in the files train.csv, val.csv, and test.csv, respectively.
